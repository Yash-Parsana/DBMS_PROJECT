# DBMS_PROJECT
We have created a database of Brokerage applications like Zerodha using PostgreSQL and SQL Query. Our Project has many modules as it provides IPO information, various company stock information, their fundamental and technical information. Also, users can find all personal or professional information that is available. Also, users can trade using this application. Create and Retrieve data officially. A brokerage account is the type of account used to buy and sell securities like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. You can transfer money into and out of a brokerage account much like a bank account, but unlike banks, brokerage accounts give you access to the stock market and other investments.
